               legacy modularity usage for eco-conception
                  draft-stephan-legacy-path-eco-design

Abstract

   This draft discusses the usage of inventory information for assessing
   the adaptation of existing devices to eco-design.  It is driven by
   the weight of the manufacturing in the sustainability cost with
   regard to the power consumption.

1.  Introduction

   Many companies have integrated sustainability improvements into their
   core business strategies.  Such trend is driven by the growing
   awareness of environmental matters and regulatory requirements like
   Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  This document discusses the benefits of leveraging
   existing devices modularity to introduce eco-designed components in
   the networks while being able to assess the gains in sustainability.

   The motivation of this approach is the urgent need to start
   decreasing resource consumption by simply replacing devices
   components.  This approach can be viewed as a very basic use case of
   GREEN-bof [GREEN-BOF] approach.

2.  Network and devices modularity

   Networks and theirs devices are modular per design to cope with
   manufacturing and operationnal obvious constraints.  Existing devices
   are going to be progressively replaced with eco-design products.
   Both will co-exist in the networks as there is a balance to find
   between the increase of the live duration of existing devices and
   their replacement with eco-design devices [SUST-INS].

   The same approach applies at the same time to individual devices:
   legacy devices will include progressively more and more eco-designed
   hardware components.

   Eco Design means that the products include environmental
   considerations throughout their entire lifecycle to reduce their
   environmental impact.  In France they are based on General Reference
   Base for Eco-Design in digital services ("RGESN") at
   https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-
   general-ecoconception/.

   Eco-design can be summarized as the concepts and current practices
   related to the integration of environmental aspects into every stage
   of a product lifecycle.  This starts at product design and
   development [ISO/TR 14062:2002 ]

   The upgrade of legacy devices with eco-designed cards can be separate
   in 2 categories:

   *  "Simple" update : The adaptation is simple, a card is 'just'
      replaced with another one which consumes significally less power
      by itself when running and which required less ressources during
      its manufacturing and its deployment.

   *  "Complex" update: The replacement of the card requires the adding
      or the update of software components to enable dynamic power
      consumption.

3.  Simple Update

   Network operators update their devices components since decades.  By
   consequence, update with eco-designed components can started
   immediatly as there is no dependency on management solutions.  The
   assessement of environmental and power gains can be done manually or
   with adhoc scripts from the datasheets of the manufacturer or using
   an adhoc processing.

   It is clear that information for doing static assessement is spread
   over many media or OPS interfaces (datasheet, Web URL, CLI , YANG,
   MIB, IPFIX ...).  A proposal consists in documenting how to do static
   assessement for a set of devices and components based on volontaring
   [GREEN-BOF].

   In the mid term, in a way to scale the assessement, inventory
   [IVY-WG] requires to distinguish legacy devices which include eco-
   designed components and eco-designed components inside legacy
   devices.  This must not delay the initial deployment of eco-designed
   components in legacy devices described above.

3.1.  Simple Software Update

   Software modularity increases with the generalisation of continuous
   developpement and deployement approaches.  Power consumption of
   current software components of network devices are rarely evaluated.
   They can be updated immediatly 'just' by replacing with another one
   which consumes significally less power by itself.

   It might seem inappropriate to try to decrease the power consumption
   of a software component as intituively it is only doing what is
   expected, so this can't be reduced.

   This exists for assessing power efficiency of Web application
   components with good results.  As an example, GreenIT is available as
   a browser plugin https://github.com/cnumr/GreenIT-Analysis.

4.  Complex Update

   Currently network devices are mostly always-on.  The design of their
   software components do not include dynamic power management.

   The update of legacy networks and devices to support dynamic power
   management is something complex because it impacts the different type
   of components:

   *  hardware component must support variation of power, of bit rate or
      only being shutdown and restarted

   *  firmware component must expose the monitoring and the actionable
      functions to the software components

   *  software component must be updated or added to operate these new
      capabilities

   Legacy hardware components are designed for being rarely stopped and
   re-started.  The rythm of start/stop supported by such components
   must be documented to prevent wrong usage of their real capacity.
   This must be present in the datasheet or exposed by the components
   themselve.

5.  Gain measurements

   On the short term, as promoted by the GREEN-BoF, the assessement at
   the device level requires firstly datamodels augmentation [IVY-WG] to
   expose these capabilities and configuration updates and then metrics
   to measure the power consumption [POWEFF].

   There is room for hackathon sessions to compare asessment methods.

6.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal information of the device
   usages.

7.  IANA Considerations

   At this step this document has no IANA actions.
