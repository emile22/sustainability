                  draft-stephan-legacy-path-eco-design

Abstract

   This document discusses the usage of inventory-maintained information
   for assessing the adaptation of existing devices to eco-design.  This
   assessment is driven by the weight of the manufacturing in the
   sustainability cost with regard to the power consumption.

1.  Introduction

   Many companies have integrated sustainability improvements into their
   core business strategies.  Such trend is driven by the growing
   awareness of environmental matters and regulatory requirements like
   Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), a regulatory
   framework proposed by the European Commission to enhance corporate
   transparency and ensure that companies provide comparable information
   to assess their sustainability performance.

   Sustainability impacts numerous aspects of the life cycle management
   (LCM) of devices.  This document discusses the benefits of leveraging
   existing devices modularity to introduce eco-designed components in
   the networks while being able to assess the gains in sustainability.

   The motivation of this approach is the urgent need to start
   decreasing resource consumption by simply replacing devices
   components.  This approach can be viewed as a very basic use case of
   GREEN-bof [GREEN-BOF] approach.

2.  Network and Devices Modularity

   Many Networks and networking devices (e.g., routers, switches, or
   Network Functions (NFs)) are designed with some modularity to cope
   with manufacturing and operational constraints.  However, the
   modularity level is a still implementation and deployment specific.
   It is expected that legacy devices will be progressively replaced
   with eco-design products.  Both will co-exist in networks as there is
   a balance to find between the increase of the live duration of
   existing devices and their replacement with eco-design devices
   [SUST-INS].

   The same approach applies at the same time to individual devices:
   legacy devices will include progressively more and more eco-designed
   hardware components.

   Eco-design means that the products include environmental
   considerations throughout their entire lifecycle to reduce their
   environmental impact.  In France they are based on General Reference
   Base for Eco-Design in digital services ("RGESN") at
   https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-
   general-ecoconception/.

   Eco-design can be summarized as the concepts and current practices
   related to the integration of environmental aspects into every stage
   of a product lifecycle.  This starts at product design and
   development [ISO/TR 14062:2002 ]

   The upgrade of legacy devices with eco-designed cards can be separate
   in 2 categories:

   *  "Simple" update : The adaptation is simple, a card is 'just'
      replaced with another one which consumes significantly less power
      by itself when running and which required fewer resources during
      its manufacturing and its deployment.

   *  "Complex" update: The replacement of the card requires the adding
      or the update of software components to enable dynamic power
      consumption.

3.  Simple Update

   Network operators have been updating their devices' components for
   decades.  Consequently, replacement with eco-designed components can
   be begun immediately as there is no dependency on management
   solutions.  The assessment of environmental and power gains can be
   done manually or with ad hoc scripts from the datasheets of the
   manufacturer or using an ad hoc process.

   It is clear that information for doing static assessment is spread
   over many mediums or OPS interfaces (datasheet, Web URL, CLI , YANG,
   MIB, IPFIX ...).  A proposal consists in documenting how to do static
   assessment for a set of devices and components based on volunteering
   [GREEN-BOF].

   In the mid-term, in a way to scale the assessment, inventory [IVY-WG]
   requires distinguishing legacy devices which include eco-designed
   components and eco-designed components inside legacy devices.  This
   must not delay the initial deployment of eco-designed components in
   legacy devices described above.

3.1.  Simple Software Update

   Software modularity increases with the generalisation of continuous
   development and deployment approaches.  Power consumption of current
   software components of network devices is rarely evaluated.  They can
   be updated immediately 'just' by replacing with another one which
   consumes significantly less power by itself.

   It might seem inappropriate to try to decrease the power consumption
   of a software component as intuitively it is only doing what is
   expected, so this can't be reduced.  However, software does not
   always use resources optimally and software updates can significantly
   improve or degrade performance and resource consumption.

   This exists for assessing power efficiency of Web application
   components with good results.  As an example, GreenIT is available as
   a browser plugin https://github.com/cnumr/GreenIT-Analysis.

4.  Complex Update

   Currently network devices are mostly always-on.  The design of their
   software components do not include dynamic power management.

   The update of legacy networks and devices to support dynamic power
   management is a complex topic because it impacts the different type
   of components:

   *  hardware components must support variation of power, of bit rate
      or only being shutdown and restarted

   *  firmware components must expose monitoring and actionable
      functions to software components

   *  software components must be updated or added to operate these new
      capabilities

   Legacy hardware components are rarely designed to be stopped and
   restarted.  The rhythm of start/stop supported by such components
   must be documented to prevent wrong usage of their real capacity.
   This must be present in the datasheet or exposed by the components
   themselves.

5.  Path Toward Dynamic Assessement

   In the short-term, as promoted by several discussions in the GREEN-
   BoF mailing list, the device level assessment requires datamodels
   augmentation [IVY-WG] to expose these capabilities and configuration
   updates first, and metrics to measure the power consumption [POWEFF]
   second.

   In parallel it should document a parsable string giving the minimum
   information about the parts of a legacy device which migrated to
   sustainability.

   Hackathon sessions can be used to compare assessment methods based
   either on inventory metadata or metrics.

6.  Legacy Device and Energy efficiency

   Legacy network devices energy efficiency monitoring and control
   differ from end-user devices.  Network devices power consumption is
   implictly taken in account during the dimensioning of a network as
   they are alway powered.  The maximum power consumtion occurs once
   deployed.  On the opposite, end-user portable devices power
   consumption is explictly managed as they rely on battery and their
   maximum power consumtion occur during their manufacturing.  None of
   these types of devices expose explicitly their energy efficiency.

6.1.  IETF EMAN WG

   The Eman WG produced the specifications for managing the energy
   produced and consumed by a broad types of devices.

7.  Use Cases

7.1.  Device replacement in a DC

   Legacy hardware had to be replaced after reaching end-of-life (6+
   years of constant use), replacement components for older hardware
   became scarcer.

   Two objectives of the replacement:

   1.  reduce power consumption using newer hardware

   2.  reduce footprint in datacenter using denser devices (i.e., ~120
       devices replaced by 30)

   Before the project started it was difficult to estimate the power
   consumption reduction of the project.  Only some components had idle
   consumption and max consumption power metrics, which would be used to
   compare inventory before and after.

   During and after the project, active power consumption could only be
   measured from some components (e.g., cpu power consumption estimated
   via current and voltage sensors), and from the power distribution at
   each rack (where only a subset of devices were replaced).

   One goal of the project could not be achieved: measure impact of
   increased density of devices (i.e., fan size impact moving from 1U to
   2U devices which can be attributed to cooling) due to insufficient
   granularity of power consumption metrics (at component level).

   Standardization of power consumption metrics (e.g. idle/max) for
   inventory would improve measurement for legacy hardware replacement
   projects.  Improved power delivery designs inside racks already
   improves ability to measure real-time device power consumption, this
   allows device replacement projects to accurately measure impact.
   Devices reporting granular per-component power consumption metrics
   would allow component replacement projects to accurately measure
   reduction.

8.  Security Considerations

   The tracking of LCM information may reveal device usage information.

   Device inventory can be used by attackers when assessing a system for
   vulnerable components.

9.  IANA Considerations

   At this step this document has no IANA actions.
